# Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci numbers form a sequence such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

Given `n`, calculate F(n).

## Example
```javascript
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1

Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
```
